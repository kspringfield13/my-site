## Context
Manual content generation and distribution can bottleneck experiments and audience iteration.

## Approach
Implemented an OpenAI-powered automation workflow generating text/images and posting to X and Discord.

## Architecture
Prompt templates -> generation services -> media pipeline -> channel posting adapters.

## Results
Reduced manual publishing overhead and increased iteration speed for content experiments.

## Lessons
Automation quality improves when editorial constraints are encoded up front.

## Artifacts

## If I had 2 more weeks...
Add policy guardrails and per-channel adaptive tone tuning.
