## Context
Business users need conversational analytics that still respects modeled data contracts.

## Approach
Built a full-stack assistant with FastAPI + OpenAI/LangChain on top of DuckDB/dbt models and a React/Next interface.

## Architecture
UI query layer -> API orchestration -> retrieval + LLM response synthesis -> dbt-modeled warehouse tables.

## Results
Enabled faster exploratory analysis while maintaining traceability to governed data models.

## Lessons
Conversation UX improves only when response grounding and metric definitions are explicit.

## If I had 2 more weeks...
Ship richer source citations and query execution observability.
