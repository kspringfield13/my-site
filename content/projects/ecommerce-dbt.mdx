## Context
Analytics teams need reproducible dbt patterns that cover modeling, testing, docs, and CI from day one.

## Approach
Created an end-to-end e-commerce pipeline on DuckDB with layered models, schema tests, and docs generation in CI.

## Architecture
Raw staging -> intermediate transforms -> marts -> schema tests/docs -> CI validation.

## Results
Produced a reusable analytics engineering starter that emphasizes reliability and maintainability.

## Lessons
Automated testing and docs are not polish; they are core delivery infrastructure.

## Artifacts

## If I had 2 more weeks...
Add semantic layer examples and freshness SLA checks.
