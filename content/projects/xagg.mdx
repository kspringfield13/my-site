## Context
Analysts tracking market context need faster signal aggregation across news and financial inputs.

## Approach
Built a Streamlit app combining headline streams and market data feeds into one exploration interface.

## Architecture
Data connectors -> normalization layer -> scoring/filter logic -> Streamlit presentation.

## Results
Created a rapid context dashboard for monitoring topical and market movement.

## Lessons
Signal usefulness depends on ranking and filtering, not just source volume.

## Artifacts

## If I had 2 more weeks...
Add alerting thresholds and persistent watchlists.
