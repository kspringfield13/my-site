## Context
Teams adopting Snowflake often need reference ELT patterns beyond isolated SQL scripts.

## Approach
Developed modular dbt + Snowflake pipeline conventions for reliable ingestion and transformation.

## Architecture
Source ingestion -> Snowflake staging -> dbt model layers -> curated marts and outputs.

## Results
Delivered a maintainable blueprint for analytics engineering workflows in Snowflake.

## Lessons
Model layering and naming discipline prevent long-term complexity blowups.

## Artifacts

## If I had 2 more weeks...
Package reusable macros for cross-domain standardization.
