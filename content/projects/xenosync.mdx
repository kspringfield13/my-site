## Context
Parallel coding and analysis sessions create coordination overhead and merge conflicts.

## Approach
Designed a controller pattern to assign tasks to specialized agents and collect outputs into a structured merge queue.

## Architecture
Coordinator service -> session workers -> merge/reconciliation layer -> final artifact pipeline.

## Results
Improved throughput for multi-thread implementation work while reducing failed joins.

## Lessons
Agent orchestration quality depends more on control-plane design than prompt quality alone.

## Artifacts
- Repo: https://github.com/kspringfield13/xenosync

## If I had 2 more weeks...
Add conflict scoring and detailed run telemetry dashboards.
