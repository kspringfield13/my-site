Good analytics systems are less about dashboards and more about decision velocity under uncertainty.

## Pattern

Start with one decision, then map backward to the minimum reliable data contract needed to support it.

## Failure mode

Teams often optimize for report quantity instead of decision quality.

## Better default

Treat every metric as a product surface with ownership, reliability targets, and explicit lifecycle.
