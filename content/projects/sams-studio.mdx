## Context
Studio operations often split scheduling, bookings, payments, waivers, and reporting across disconnected tools.

## Approach
Built a unified platform to centralize operations with role-specific workflows for admins, instructors, and clients.

## Architecture
Next.js app + Supabase data/auth + Stripe billing + Capacitor mobile packaging.

## Results
Teams can manage the full client lifecycle from booking through payments and attendance reporting in one system.

## Lessons
Operational products become far more useful when role permissions and day-to-day workflows are first-class in the architecture.

## Artifacts

## If I had 2 more weeks...
Expand automation around retention nudges, cohort analytics, and instructor workload optimization.
